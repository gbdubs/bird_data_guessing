# Bird Data Estimation

Given a bird's latin and english names, scrape the web
to try to ascertain the association of the bird with several
properties:

- what do they eat?
- where do they live?
- what type of nests do they build?
- what is their average wingspan?
- how many eggs do they typically lay?
- what is a fun fact about them?

This repository answers these questions by scraping several
sites, mostly attempting regex searches and phrase extractions.

Output is produced alongside a chain of atributions that cites
to the pages that sourced the information, and how they were
combined to produce the final result.

This project has required me to spin off many of the sub-problems
as reusable repos. That is a good thing, but makes versioning
these much trickier. For now, since this code isn't ready for
other people to look at, I just recommend waiting for it to be
finished. :)
